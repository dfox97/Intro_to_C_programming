The purpose of the program was to allow the user to input three characters from the keyboard and for the program to detect those three characters and produce them in a pyramid. In this program it uses functions and other basic programming features like pointers which help make the program work. As the program runs it asks the user to input three characters using the scanf function and once the user inputs the three characters it automatically makes a pyramid of the three letters inputted. The main objective was to make the pyramid successfully print out using the characters the user has input.

The purpose of this program was to allow the user to certain details to calculate the overall salary for the drivers. As the program runs it asks the user to input a case type (a or b) anything else is an invalid case number. As the user inputs the case it then asks for the distances off three different areas after this it then calculated the fuel cost, salary cost and total cost of a journey entered. The program also uses calculations to determine the gallons to litres conversion which is needed to calculate the final costs for the user. In my program this will be printed out and show to the user in case they need to know how much gallons or how much litres they are using in the certain areas.
