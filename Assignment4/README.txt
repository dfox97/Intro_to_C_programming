The purpose of the program was to create a encryption and decryption program for a software company, the companies purpose was to send files containing important confidential information between the users. The program uses an algorithm to make the confidential information unreadable unless a key is used to unlock the algorithm which is only known by the user. The users information is read in a txt format and converted to different characters using the ASCII table and the numerical key. If the message becomes longer than the key then the key should repeat over and over until the key length is equal to the message length. Also if the key length is longer than the message then the key should be discarded to match the length of the message. The program reads two separate text files “input.txt” and “key.txt” files these names could be different that the two presented however these are the ones used in this report. The program reads the message and the key from two separate files and creates an encrypted text in a new empty file. If the key is known to the program , the program should be able to allow the decryption to process and create the original message.

The encryption algorithm which was specified in the assignment was to be used in the program , this is given below;

encrypted[i] = message[i] + key[i]
 	
3 text files where created the first being the message the user will want to place for encryption , then the second text document was the key which will unlock the code for decryption. The final file was the output file which was left blank, this file can be created again if the user wants to name the file something else, this file was just created for test purposes.
