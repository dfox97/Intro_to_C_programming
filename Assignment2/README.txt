In this assignment two tasks where given for completion, the first is to design a program for a telecommunications company to calculate monthly bills.
The second part of the assignment is to program a calculation which was called Kurtosis and use local functions , math functions where not allowed.

The purpose of this program was to calculate the monthly bills for a telecommunications service company. The company provides three different services these include; telephone , internet and television bills. Each user can only have one service and the program should ask the user to enter an account number which must be in an unsigned int and a service code which must be in type char. The program should also tell the user if the code is valid and both lower case and upper case need to be used.

This program was to write a program to compute the value of a metric called kurtosis , this metric is used to describe certain properties of a random variable (this means a variable which takes random values). In this exercise all values are assumed that they are positive and not negative . The expression is shown below.
